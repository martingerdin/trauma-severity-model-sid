abstract = {The Trauma and Injury Severity Scoring (TRISS) system was developed in the 1980s to improve the prediction of patient outcomes following trauma through the use of physiological and anatomical criteria. The TRISS is used for a number of purposes, including quantifying the severity of injury of a patient population, calculating the probability of survival of patients for identification of cases for peer review, and comparing the death or survival rates of different populations/hospitals. Despite the advancements in trauma care, improved statistical techniques, and the identification of numerous limitations of TRISS, it continues to be the most commonly used tool for judging hospital performance and monitoring trauma death rates. This article critically evaluates the development, structure, and practical use of TRISS to determine its value in the current trauma environment. Limitations of TRISS are discussed and suggestions are made for the future development of trauma prediction tools.},

METHODS: Adult patients directly admitted to the neurosurgical intensive care units of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka between 21st July 2014 and 1st October 2014 with moderate or severe TBI were recruited. A telephone administered questionnaire based on the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended (GOSE) was used to assess functional outcome of patients at 3 and 6 months after injury. The economic impact of the injury was assessed before injury, and at 3 and 6 months after injury. RESULTS: One hundred and one patients were included in the study. Survival at ICU discharge, 3 and 6 months after injury was 68.3{\%}, 49.5{\%} and 45.5{\%} respectively. Of the survivors at 3 months after injury, 43 (86{\%}) were living at home. Only 19 (38{\%}) patients had a good recovery (as defined by GOSE 7 and 8). Three months and six months after injury, respectively 25 (50{\%}) and 14 (30.4{\%}) patients had become "economically dependent". Selected trauma scores had poor discriminatory ability in predicting mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This observational study of patients sustaining moderate or severe TBI in Sri Lanka (a LMIC) reveals only 46{\%} of patients were alive at 6 months after ICU discharge and only 20{\%} overall attained a good (GOSE 7 or 8) recovery. The social and economic consequences of TBI were long lasting in this setting. Injury Severity Score, Revised Trauma Score, A Severity Characterization of Trauma and Trauma and Injury Severity Score, all performed poorly in predicting mortality in this setting and illustrate the need for setting adapted tools.},

Study Design and Setting: We used data from consecutive primary care patients suspected of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) to develop and validate a diagnostic model for the presence of DVT. Missing values were imputed 10 times with the MICE conditional imputation method. After the selection of predictors and transformations for continuous predictors according to three different methods, we estimated regression coefficients and performance measures. Results: The three methods to select predictors and transformations of continuous predictors showed similar results. Rubin's rules could easily be applied to estimate regression coefficients and performance measures, once predictors and transformations were selected. Conclusion: We provide a practical approach for model development and validation with multiply imputed data. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

We compared the decisions made by clinicians with the Revised Trauma Score (RTS), the Glasgow Coma Scale, Age and Systolic Blood Pressure (GAP) score, the Kampala Trauma Score (KTS) and the Gerdin et al model. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting Three hospitals in urban India. Participants In total, 7697 adult patients who presented to participating hospitals with a history of trauma were approached for enrolment. The final study sample included 5155 patients. The majority (4023, 78.0{\%}) were male. Main outcome measure The patient outcome was mortality within 30 days of arrival at the participating hospital. A grid search was used to identify model cut-off values. Clinicians and categorised models were evaluated and compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROCC) and net reclassification improvement in non-survivors (NRI+) and survivors (NRI-) separately. Results The differences in AUROCC between each categorised model and the clinicians were 0.016 (95{\%} CI -0.014 to 0.045) for RTS, 0.019 (95{\%} CI -0.007 to 0.058) for GAP, 0.054 (95{\%} CI 0.033 to 0.077) for KTS and -0.007 (95{\%} CI -0.035 to 0.03) for Gerdin et al. The NRI+ for each model were -0.235 (-0.37 to -0.116), 0.17 (-0.042 to 0.405), 0.55 (0.47 to 0.65) and 0.22 (0.11 to 0.717), respectively. The NRI- were 0.385 (0.348 to 0.4), -0.059 (-0.476 to -0.005), -0.162 (-0.18 to -0.146) and 0.039 (-0.229 to 0.06), respectively. Conclusion The findings of this study suggest that there are no substantial differences in discrimination and net reclassification improvement between clinicians and all four clinical prediction models when using 30-day mortality as the outcome of ED trauma triage in adult patients.

@article{VanderLaan2007,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}When trying to learn a model for the prediction of an outcome given a set of covariates, a statistician has many estimation procedures in their toolbox. A few examples of these candidate learners are: least squares, least angle regression, random forests, and spline regression. Previous articles (van der Laan and Dudoit (2003); van der Laan et al. (2006); Sinisi et al. (2007)) theoretically validated the use of cross validation to select an optimal learner among many candidate learners. Motivated by this use of cross validation, we propose a new prediction method for creating a weighted combination of many candidate learners to build the super learner. This article proposes a fast algorithm for constructing a super learner in prediction which uses V-fold cross-validation to select weights to combine an initial set of candidate learners. In addition, this paper contains a practical demonstration of the adaptivity of this so called super learner to various true data generating distributions. This approach for construction of a super learner generalizes to any parameter which can be defined as a minimizer of a loss function.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Vergouwe2010,
abstract = {Objective: To illustrate the sequence of steps needed to develop and validate a clinical prediction model, when missing predictor values have been multiply imputed. Study Design and Setting: We used data from consecutive primary care patients suspected of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) to develop and validate a diagnostic model for the presence of DVT. Missing values were imputed 10 times with the MICE conditional imputation method. After the selection of predictors and transformations for continuous predictors according to three different methods, we estimated regression coefficients and performance measures. Results: The three methods to select predictors and transformations of continuous predictors showed similar results. Rubin's rules could easily be applied to estimate regression coefficients and performance measures, once predictors and transformations were selected. Conclusion: We provide a practical approach for model development and validation with multiply imputed data. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},
